# Image recognition without the use of mainstream computer vision libraries

I will attempt to build image recognition software without the help of mainstream computer vision libraries such as OpenCV2 and SimpleCV.

I will use edge detection.

### Topics to research and use:
- edge detection (gradient?)
- haar cascase (specifically how does it work)
- also need to find papers on image recog to see what are common techniques

### TODO
finish readme
